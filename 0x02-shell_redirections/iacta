Once upon a time there lived a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. 
Her mother had a little red riding hood made for her. Everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One day her mother said to her: “Go my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill.”
Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately.
